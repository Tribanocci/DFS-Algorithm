# DFS-Algorithm
Implements Depth-First Search in a graph. So the original graph is the input and the output is a subgraph of the dfs tree


In order to run the program save all files in the same directory and then from the command prompt type:
                    gcc -o project1 dfs_graph.c graph.c stack.c
                    
                    
In order to change the input Graph, open the dfs_graph.c file and insisde the Edge set, give the starting and ending node of its edge
